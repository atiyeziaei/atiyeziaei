## 👩‍💻 About Me

I'm a curious, persistent, and ambitious developer who believes in learning endlessly.  
I see coding not only as a career — but as an art of creating something valuable that lasts.

I have **3 years of professional experience in Support Management for ERP systems**, including:

- Managing SQL-based reporting and analytics  
- Working with PowerBI to design insightful dashboards  
- KPI analysis for customer success  
- Software testing & QA  
- SoftStimule automation  
- Deep understanding of enterprise workflows  

I enjoy exploring AI/ML, data-driven systems, and intelligent automation — things that push technology forward and reshape how we live and work.

Every project I build comes from a desire to grow, experiment, and make something better than before.
